Hi! I’m a computer scientist, educator, and founder of [**Rumah Coding**](https://rumahcoding.co.id), a startup dedicated to advancing coding education across Indonesia. I have a passion for applied AI, especially in the fields of computer vision, deep learning, and generative models.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Indonesia, where I focused on urban change detection using satellite imagery and vision transformers. My research has been featured in publications like *IEEE Access* and presented at international conferences, earning awards such as Best Student Paper at IWBIS.

Beyond research, I’m committed to growing the tech talent pipeline in Indonesia. Through Rumah Coding, I’ve designed and delivered hands-on training in AI, data science, and software development for students, professionals, and government institutions. I also regularly serve as a guest lecturer and speaker at tech events and universities. My current mission is to explore how AI—especially generative models—can be applied to solve real-world problems while empowering the next generation of innovators.
