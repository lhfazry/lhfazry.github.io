excerpt: "Fractal images are images that have the property of self-similarity. This means that the fractals consist of parts that look the same as the image itself as a whole. This research aims to perform image compression using the fractal image compression method. The principle of fractal image compression is to find the domain block that is most similar to the range block, then apply a contractive affine transformation that maps the domain block to that range block. Experiments on image compression using the fractal image compression method provide a fairly high compression ratio. The application of genetic algorithms in fractal image compression aims to reduce the number of domain block and range block fittings, thereby shortening the compression time."

Fractal images are images that have the property of self-similarity. This means that the fractals consist of parts that look the same as the image itself as a whole. This research aims to perform image compression using the fractal image compression method. The principle of fractal image compression is to find the domain block that is most similar to the range block, then apply a contractive affine transformation that maps the domain block to that range block. Experiments on image compression using the fractal image compression method provide a fairly high compression ratio. The application of genetic algorithms in fractal image compression aims to reduce the number of domain block and range block fittings, thereby shortening the compression time.
