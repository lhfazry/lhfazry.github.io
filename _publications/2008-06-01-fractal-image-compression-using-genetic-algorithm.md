Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is a highly popular generative model. Unlike other generative models, GANs can produce highly varied synthetic data (unseen data). Additionally, GANs offer flexibility in the use of objective functions. However, GAN training is often unstable and prone to mode collapse. Many solutions have been proposed to address this issue, including the use of Sinkhorn loss with positively regularized features via spectral normalization. Yet, the complexity of spectral normalization is relatively high. In this research, we attempt to replace the use of spectral normalization with a lighter approach: spectral bounding.
