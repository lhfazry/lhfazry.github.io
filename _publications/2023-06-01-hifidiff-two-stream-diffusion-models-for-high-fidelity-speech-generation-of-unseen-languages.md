excerpt: "Speech generation aims to produce synthetic speech that mimics natural speech’s properties. However, pitch inaccuracies exist in voiced and unvoiced sounds when the trained model is conditioned on unseen languages. This paper proposes HifiDiff, a two-stream diffusion model for separately generating voiced and unvoiced sounds."

Speech generation aims to produce synthetic speech that mimics natural speech’s properties. However, pitch inaccuracies exist in voiced and unvoiced sounds when the trained model is conditioned on unseen languages. This paper proposes HifiDiff, a two-stream diffusion model for separately generating voiced and unvoiced sounds. Our approach outperforms the baseline method in most unseen language datasets for the mean opinion score (MOS) metric. This result concludes the effectiveness of our approach to resolving the problem of speech generation in unseen languages.
