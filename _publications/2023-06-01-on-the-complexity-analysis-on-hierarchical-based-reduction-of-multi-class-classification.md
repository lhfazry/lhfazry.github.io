Multi-class classification is a common problem on many applications accross domains, including document categorization, object classification and speech recognition. Common approach to solve multi-class classification is to reduce it into multiple binary classification. There are some reduction methods including One-versus-All (OVA), One-versus-One (OVO) and Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC). In this paper we review a relatively new reduction methods which reduce multi-class classfication into hierarchical binary classification. We analyze the complexity of the methods and compare it with the state-of-the-art methods.
